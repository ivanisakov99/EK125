 
The second portion of this course introduces C, a powerful programming language which will be very useful in your future. C works a little different than what you have been exposed to with MATLAB so far.
 
In MATLAB, you have written scripts and functions that you can call and run at the click of a button, all within the Matlab program itself. MATLAB code can be interpreted and run on the fly. Interpreted languages typically translate programs one statement at a time as they are run. C, on the other hand, is what is known as a compiled language. When writing in a compiled language, an extra step is needed in order to translate the code to something a computer can understand. This process is known as compiling, where all statements written in a program are converted into instructions that the underlying processor can understand and put into a separate file.

After you have created your C code, it will have the extension ‘.c’. The next step will be to compile your file, which will then be ready to execute!

You will continue to write code, but in a different syntax and in a somewhat different interface.
